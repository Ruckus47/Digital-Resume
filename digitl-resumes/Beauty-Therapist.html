                <strong>Glow Haven Spa (2 years) and Royal Touch Salon (1 year)</strong>
                <p>üóì01/02/2020 to 05/08/2023</p>
                <p>At Glow Haven Spa, where I worked for two years, I honed my skills as a beauty therapist in a serene, client-focused environment that emphasized holistic wellness.
                    My role involved performing a range of treatments, from facials and body massages to specialized skincare consultations, catering to a diverse clientele seeking relaxation and rejuvenation.
                    I thrived in the collaborative atmosphere, working closely with colleagues to create personalized treatment plans, which deepened my understanding of skin health and client care.
                    The spa‚Äôs commitment to using organic, high-quality products aligned with my passion for natural beauty solutions, and I developed expertise in tailoring services to address specific skin concerns, building a loyal client base through trust and results.</p>
                <p>Transitioning to Royal Touch Salon for a year, I expanded my expertise into makeup artistry, complementing my beauty therapy background with a fast-paced, glamorous setting.
                    The salon‚Äôs vibrant energy pushed me to master creative makeup techniques, from bridal looks to editorial styles, while still offering select spa treatments like waxing and threading.
                    I enjoyed the dynamic pace, collaborating with hairstylists and other artists to deliver cohesive looks for events, which sharpened my time management and adaptability.
                    Though the salon environment was less focused on wellness compared to Glow Haven, it allowed me to showcase my versatility, blending precise makeup application with my therapeutic skills to enhance clients‚Äô confidence for special occasions..</p>
                <h5>Achievements</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Over two years, I cultivated strong relationships with clients through personalized skincare consultations and treatments, resulting in a consistent return rate of over 70% for my services, with many clients specifically requesting me for their monthly facials and wellness treatments.</li>
                    <li>At Glow Haven Spa, I became proficient in advanced facial treatments, including microdermabrasion and chemical peels, successfully treating clients with concerns like acne and hyperpigmentation, which led to a 30% increase in bookings for these services during my tenure.</li>
                    <li> In my year at Royal Touch, I designed and executed over 50 bridal makeup looks, earning praise for my ability to enhance natural beauty while ensuring long-lasting results, with several clients sharing their wedding photos on social media, boosting the salon‚Äôs visibility.</li>
                    <li>Across both roles, I developed a system for managing appointments and tailoring treatment plans, reducing session times by 15% at Glow Haven Spa without compromising quality and enabling Royal Touch Salon to accommodate 10% more clients during peak event seasons.</li>
